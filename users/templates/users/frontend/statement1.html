      <p>
        Create a new, refreshed key visual for Commencement Class Giving 2022.
        The design should inspire pride in being affiliated with NUS, as well as
        encourage students to leave a legacy by making a gift in support of
        their juniors.

        A key visual is not a logo design, but an effective add-on to the logo.
        A key visual refers to an image motif used in campaigns in order to
        enhance brand recognition. The message and context of a campaign should
        be easily and quickly grasped from the key visual.
