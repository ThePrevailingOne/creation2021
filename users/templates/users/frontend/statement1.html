        Create a new, refreshed key visual for Commencement Class Giving 2022.
        The design should inspire pride in being affiliated with NUS, as well as
        encourage students to leave a legacy by making a gift in support of
        their juniors.

      <strong><u>Challenge Background </u></strong>
      <br>
      <br>
A key visual refers to an image motif used in campaigns in order to enhance brand recognition. The message and context of a campaign should be easily and quickly grasped from the key visual.
<br>
<br>
The key visual should encapsulate a strong concept that is different from recent years. It should include distinct elements that are adaptable and scalable. Bear in mind that the key visual is intended to be used across multiple channels with various taglines/call-to-action (e.g. web banners, emailers, lamp post banners, floor stickers, etc).
<br><br>
There is no need to use NUS colours. Please refrain from using education or giving-related symbols/icons/motifs (e.g. heart, hands, gift box, plant, book, mortarboard, scroll, etc.).
<br><br>
Commencement Class Giving is an annual tradition in which the graduating cohort of NUS comes together to celebrate convocation by making a single gift ($20.22 for Class of 2022) in support of their juniors. By leaving a legacy through their giving, the cohort contributes to current and future students in financial need, as well as activities that will enrich campus life.
